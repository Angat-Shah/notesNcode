> [!TIP]
> If you have relevant academic material or practical resources worth sharing, you’re welcome to contribute to this repository.

**notesNcode** is a structured collection of academic and practical resources compiled over the course of my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. It includes handwritten notes, lab programs, reference material and exam content — all organized semester-wise and shared for easy access and future reference.

Originally stored privately, this material is now made public to be useful for others who may need dependable study resources, revision notes or properly organized codebases related to core CSE subjects.

## Contents

- Handwritten notes prepared during semesters  
- Clean, working lab programs with outputs  
- Assignments and subject-wise reports  
- Reference material used for exam preparation  
- Semester-wise folder structure for easier navigation

## Purpose

This repository is not intended to be a comprehensive or official study guide. It is shared as-is, purely as a reference for students who may find it helpful during their own coursework or revision. All files are contributed from personal study efforts and project work.
